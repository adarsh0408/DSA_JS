## Time Complexity

Time complexity measures the amount of time an algorithm takes to run, expressed as a function of the input size. Understanding time complexity is crucial for efficient algorithm design.

### Why Consider Time Complexity?

- **Better Programs:** Efficient algorithms lead to faster and more responsive programs.
- **Algorithm Comparison:** Helps in choosing the most suitable algorithm for a given task.

### Big O Notation (O-notation)

- **Upper Bound:** Describes the maximum growth rate of an algorithm's running time.

### Theta Notation (Θ-notation)

- **Average-case Complexity:** Describes the average growth rate of an algorithm's running time.

### Omega Notation (Ω-notation)

- **Lower Bound:** Describes the minimum growth rate of an algorithm's running time.

### Common Time Complexities

- **Constant Time (O(1)):** Execution time remains constant regardless of input size.
- **Linear Time (O(n)):** Execution time grows linearly with the input size.
- **Logarithmic Time (O(log n)):** Execution time grows logarithmically with the input size.
- **Quadratic Time (O(n^2)):** Execution time grows proportionally to the square of the input size.
- **Cubic Time (O(n^3)):** Execution time grows proportionally to the cube of the input size.

### Time Complexity Hierarchy (Highest to Lowest)

| Complexity   |
|--------------|
| O(N!)         |
| O(2^N)        |
| O(N^3)        |
| O(N^2)        |
| O(N log N)    |
| O(N)          |
| O(log N)      |
| O(1)          |

## How to Avoid Time Limit Exceeded (TLE)

- **10^8 Operation Rule:** Most modern machines can perform 10^8 operations per second.

## Space Complexity

Space complexity measures the amount of memory an algorithm needs relative to the input size.
